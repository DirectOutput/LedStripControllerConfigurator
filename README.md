# LedStripControllerConfigurator

First of all: This is very old code from way back in time (approx. 2013) and I havent touched it since then. Therefore I dont have much of an idea anymore about the details.

This tool can be used to change the properties FTDI chip that I have used to create the strip controller, so DOF can recoginize the controller automatically (I think that was the idea, but I am not sure anymore).
